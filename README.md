This repository contains the implementation of a student project for the Computer Architecture Lab course, supervised by Dr. Safari at the University of Tehran. The project consists of four main parts, each represented by a tag in the repository:
Certainly! Here's a description for your GitHub repository:

1. **Basics of ARM**: The initial implementation focusing on the foundational aspects of ARM architecture.
2. **Forwarding**: Enhancements to the basic ARM model by incorporating data forwarding techniques to resolve data hazards.
3. **SRAM Integration**: Addition of SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) to the existing ARM model.
4. **Cache Implementation**: Final part of the project which includes the implementation of a cache memory system.
